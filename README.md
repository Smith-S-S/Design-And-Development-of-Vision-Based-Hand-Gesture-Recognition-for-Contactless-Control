# ðŸ‘‹ Design And Development of Vision Based Hand Gesture Recognition for Contactless Control

In this project, I developed a web application using the Streamlit library to perform WhatsApp chat analysis. The application offers chat analysis, visualization, and summarization functionalities for conversations within the past 24 hours. Leveraging the huggingface pipeline and other supporting libraries, the webapp provides valuable insights into the chat content and user interactions.


## ABSTRACT

In the realm of technology and human-computer interaction, an extensive spectrum of tasks is undertaken in this project with the aim of advancing the field of hand gesture recognition. These endeavours are multifaceted, ranging from the meticulous collection and labeling of an extensive dataset for hand gesture recognition to the development of real-time hand detection and tracking mechanisms. The hardware domain has also been ventured into, with the crafting of a sophisticated circuit using the Arduino UNO microcontroller. The work is complemented by a carefully designed user interface, rendering it user-friendly and accessible. Furthermore, a cutting-edge gesture recognition model has been delved into. The culmination of these efforts results in the successful demonstration of a mobile robot that is controlled entirely through intuitive gesture commands. 


## OBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT
â€¢	To develop a model which works in various brightness level
